## Description
America’s Job Link Alliance (AJLA) is a consortium of state workforce agencies that was formed in 2001. The technology subset of AJLA, America’s Job Link Alliance–Technical Support (AJLA-TS), dates back to 1969, and has traveled under a series of names since then, before being absorbed into AJLA in 2002. AJLA-TS is a division of the Kansas Department of Commerce, and its employees are state employees.

They provide [four products](https://www.ajla.net/products.html):

1. [America’s JobLink](https://www.ajla.net/joblink.html), a labor exchange and case management system for workforce development organizations.
2. [CertLink](https://www.ajla.net/certlink.html), allowing employers to apply for and manage Work Opportunity Tax Credit applications and certifications, and state workforce agencies to administer the WOTC program.
3. [VOCAL](https://www.ajla.net/vocal.html), a vocational portal that allows job seekers to find employment and training resources, plus a case management system for staff.
4. JobLink Mobile is a Android and iOS front-end for America’s JobLink.

AJLA also sells, as a service, [implementation, support, and hosting](https://www.ajla.net/services.html).

They employ software developers and user researchers directly, instead of outsourcing the work. Ruby on Rails is their programming language of choice, and they base their software development work on user research.
