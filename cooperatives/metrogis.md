## Description
MetroGIS is a regional GIS initiative serving the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area thatâ€™s largely focused on sharing data, but also provides some shared software. They provide [an address point editor](https://www.metrogis.org/projects/address-point-editor.aspx) (a custom Esri Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS, which must be self-hosted by users), a shared [address point aggregator](https://www.metrogis.org/projects/address-point-aggregation.aspx), and a [911 data viewer](https://www.metrogis.org/projects/9-1-1-Data-Viewer.aspx).
